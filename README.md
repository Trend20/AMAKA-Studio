### Visual hierarchy
Feedback: The content on the page is not organized in a hierachical manner to guide the user.

Suggestion: Use visual cues such as size, color, and placement to prioritize content and guide users' attention to the most important elements on the platform, 
such as calls to action or trending topics.

### Accessibility
Feedback: There is poor accessibility and it does not consider people with disability.

Suggestion: The platform should ensure that it supports a wide range of users including those with disabilities. We can use the dark mode toggle to enable users to switch between different themes.
We can also use internalization to ensure that the platform can be viewed in different languages.

### Clear Navigation
Feedback: There is no clear navigation which can allow the user to access different topics. The tabs are not well structured for easy navigation.

Suggestion: There should be an easy navigation set up for users to easily access different parts of the applications. For example that tabs used to switch between different topics can be made more visible to prevent the user from being confused 
on how to access what they want. We can increase the with ong the tabs to make them all visible of just create a dropdown select and prompt users to select the topic they are interested in.

### Homepage
<p>
  <img src="/public/images/homepage.png" alt="homepage" width="420px" height="200px"/>

### Profile Page
<p>

</p>
Feedback: Profile page design lacks personalization.

Suggestions: Incorporate design elements that reflect users' personalities and preferences.

### Feedback Mechanisms
Feedback: Lack of feedback mechanisms makes it difficult for users to provide input or report issues.

Suggestions: Implement feedback a dedicated feedback section where users can share their thoughts, report bugs, and suggest improvements.

Suggestions: Optimize the platform for speed and performance to minimize loading times. Compress images, reduce server requests, and leverage caching techniques to improve page load times.
